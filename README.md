Vertical farming applies modern technologies to revolutionize the traditional agriculture process that has remained unchanged for millennia. Because traditional farming is limited in a 2D space it is very efficient at utilizing a given amount of land for food production. Transitioning the possible area, we can cultivate to a 3D space that can sustain exponentially larger yields than a traditional farm. Vertical farming uses a soilless method of growing food, meaning we can grow the food anywhere in the world with higher yields and fewer resources. With the human population on Earth exploding, the only way we can support the food demands of the future is to expand our food production capabilities into a whole new dimensionâ€¦ Up
